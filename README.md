# Apodized Pupil Lyot Coronagraph design optimization

The apodized pupil Lyot coronagraph (APLC) is one of several coronagraph
design families that is being assessed as part of NASA's segmented
aperture coronagraph design and analysis (SCDA) study. The APLC is a Lyot-style coronagraph that suppresses
starlight through a series of amplitude operations on the on-axis field. APLCs are sensitive to several parameters, 
including telescope aperture shape and segmentation, central obscuration, Lyot stop shape and size,
focal plane mask size, dark hole size and bandwidth.

`aplc-optimization` is an object-orientated software toolkit 
to automate the exploration of APLC design parameter combinations.
