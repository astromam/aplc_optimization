Template launcher scripts are provided for HiCAT-, LUVOIR- and GPI-like instruments (named do_hicat_template.py, do_luvoir_template.py and do_gpi_template.py`, respectively).
We also provide a few specific examples of optimizations launcher scripts for each of these telescopes geometries. 
See documentation for more information.
