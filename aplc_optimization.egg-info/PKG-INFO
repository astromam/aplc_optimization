Description: # aplc-optimization: Apodized Pupil Lyot Coronagraph (APLC) design optimization toolkit
        
        `aplc-optimization` is an object-orientated software toolkit to simplify the organization,
        execution and evaluation of large APLC design surveys.
        
        Documentation can be found online at [https://aplc-optimization.readthedocs.io/](https://aplc-optimization.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

        - The `aplc-optimization` package was created in support of the [Segmented Coronagraph Design and Analysis (SCDA) study](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exep/technology/SCDA/), funded by NASA's Exoplanet Exploration Program (ExEP). The goal of this study is to develop viable coronagraph instrument concepts for a LUVOIR-type mission. The apodized pupil Lyot coronagraph (APLC) is one of several coronagraph design families that the SCDA study is assessing.
