These notebooks are standalone tools to generate / vizualize the apertures, they do not touch the aperture generation code. 
When an optimization is launched, the aperture generation code located at aplc_optimization/aplc_optimization/ is run. 
The notebooks can also be used to save the aperture files to the masks directory, and therefore bypass the aperture generation code.  
The aperture generation code will not reproduce the masks if they already exist
